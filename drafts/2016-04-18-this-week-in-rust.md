## Notable New Crates & Project Updates

# Crate of the Week

This week's Crate of the Week is [gcc](https://crates.io/crates/gcc), a crate to easily use the local C compiler, which makes FFI with a build script a breeze. Thanks to [Ulrik Sverdrup](https://users.rust-lang.org/users/bluss) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions for next week][submit_crate]!
